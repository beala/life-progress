This is a script for generating life expectancy progress bars. I used it in this blog post: http://www.usrsb.in/memento-mori.html.

To generate your own, edit the variables at the top of `life-progress.py` and run it.

```
python life-progress.py
```

I got the concept from [Scott Hendrickson](https://blog.drskippy.net/2012/11/11/age-visualization/), who in turn was inspired by Sha Hwang
